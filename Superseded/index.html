                                                I study Engineering and Arts at the Australian National University. I made this digital resource as part
                                                of a course investing the use of digital methods to reimagine historical artifacts. <br><br>
                                                I decided to focus on the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric system because I was fascinated 
                                                by the impacts this project had on both the technical and social landscape of Australia.<br><br>
                                                I built this resource using some basic web development skills, resources from the National Archives of Australia and 
                                                the use of Adobe Illustrator to create each of the character cards in the memory game. <br><br>
                                                I hope you enjoy using this digital resource! - January 2020
