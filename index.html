                                                        Thomas worked as an electrical engineer for the Snowy Hydro
                                                        scheme. He was a highly skilled
                                                        employee and during his time here, was granted 2 years of leave
                                                        to undertake work experience in
                                                        Sweden. The Snowy Hydro scheme believed that in gaining
                                                        experience abroad Mr Crawford would return

                                                        After enjoying work and life in Europe, he petitioned to remain

                                                        the 2 years previously agreed upon. The Snowy Hydro were
                                                        disappointed with this proposal
                                                        and after failed negotiations, Thomas resigned from his position
                                                        in Australia and continued
                                                        to live and work in Europe. The Authority decided to never again
                                                        re-employ Thomas, due to

                                                        Prior to working on the Snowy Hydro scheme, Francis Gibbs served
                                                        for three years in the
                                                        Royal Engineers in Great Britain as Sergeant Model-Maker and was
                                                        responsible for
                                                        constructing topographical models of military objectives and
                                                        other models required for
                                                        tactical exercises. The Snowy Hydro authority believed that Mr
                                                        Gibbs' skill sets could be
                                                        used in the construction of topographical scale models for
                                                        publicity purposes and in the
                                                        construction of models for the hydraulics laboratory.

                                                        In his first year of work with the Snowy Hydro authority he
                                                        prepared scale models of the
                                                        Snowy Mountains area which were used for display purposes in
                                                        Melbourne and Sydney.
                                                        His skills were highly sought after by the scheme and he spent
                                                        some time on transfer with
                                                        the Public Relations team in Sydney, producing display models of
                                                        the Snowy Hydro Scheme.

                                                        He was skilled with his hands and his work as a model maker also
                                                        led to work in restoring
                                                        furniture for the Snowy Hydro scheme.
