                                        on the Snowy Hydro scheme, Constance had 
                                        experience working for an Engineering company in London and as an artist. She moved to 
                                        Cooma in 1957 and her work as a tracer involved sketching detailed drawings of gates, 
                                        valves, power plants and graphs.

                                        Her skills at drawing were observed by her managers, calling her an "intelligent, 
                                        co-operative and cheerful person". Constance was also deaf but was skilled in lip 
                                        reading and could speak fairly well. She commented later in her life that "disability

                                His skills were highly sought after by the scheme and he spent some time on transfer with
